# Screenshot index and privacy rules

This page documents the images used by the release README. Each screenshot is paired with the feature it explains. The images are documentation assets, not account screenshots.

## Visual index

| Screenshot | Feature | Description | Data policy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `screenshot-home.png` | Home | The compact Home panel combines the active companion, progress, daily and period usage, provider details, and the limits status. | Synthetic rows, totals, and companion progress only. |
| `tray-and-popover.png` | Tray access | The notification-area icon opens Home without a separate taskbar button. Closing Home leaves the app resident in the tray. | Neutral illustration with no unrelated tray icons, clock, notifications, or personal app names. |
| `screenshot-shop.png` | Shop | Usage progress can be exchanged for optional eggs, Rare Candy, Mint, and Shiny Charm items. | Demonstration prices only. No wallet, billing, or account balance. |
| `screenshot-bag.png` | Bag | The local inventory shows purchased items and the explicit actions available for the active companion. | Synthetic item counts only. |
| `screenshot-collection-pokedex.png` | Pokédex | The collection records discovered stages, rarity filters, shiny ownership, and the representative Pokémon used by the companion. | Synthetic species and collection state. |
| `screenshot-collection-catchlog.png` | Catch Log | The history view separates the active companion from graduated ones and keeps each evolution chain, nature, rarity, and date together. | Neutral demonstration dates and names only. |
| `settings.png` + `screenshot-scan-folders.png` | Settings and progression | The two images belong together: the first shows the main controls, while the second shows the advanced read-only scan-folder area. | `C:\Demo\AI-Logs` is a synthetic path. No personal folders or source databases are used. |
| `floating-pet.png` | Floating companion | The optional companion window can stay visible independently from Home and outside the taskbar. | Static synthetic Pokémon state with no surrounding desktop content. |
| `shiny-banner.png` | Shiny state | A shiny companion receives a distinct visual treatment and notification moment. | Static synthetic state only. |
| `assets/gold-companion-walking.gif` | Gold overlay | The optional Gold animation crosses the screen independently from Home and remains disabled until selected in Settings. | Bundled project artwork, not a desktop capture. |

## Settings and progression

The Settings pair is intentionally kept in one README row so the reader can see the control surface and its advanced scan section together.

### General controls

- **Language** selects the interface language.
- **Refresh interval** chooses a periodic refresh from one to fifteen minutes, or manual refresh.
- **Limit display** chooses used or remaining values when official quota data is available.
- **Launch at login** controls startup behavior.
- **Representative Pokémon** selects the collected species shown in the tray and floating companion.

### Tray and companion controls

The tray tooltip can independently show today's tokens, today's cost, and official limit percentages. The floating companion can be enabled, hidden, and resized. The optional Gold walking overlay has its own toggle and size control.

### Updates and support

Settings includes an explicit update check, an update-notification preference, a project link, an issue link, and the Ko-fi support link. Local usage aggregation does not depend on a remote service.

### Advanced scan folders

Additional folders are selected explicitly and read in JSON/JSONL counter-only mode. The app does not write to those folders, does not modify Hermes or provider databases, and does not need prompt or message bodies.

## Capture method

Prefer the packaged app launched with an isolated temporary state directory and isolated empty provider roots. If a desktop capture is necessary, use a clean Windows profile or crop and redact the entire surrounding desktop before saving.

Before adding an image:

1. inspect every visible pixel for usernames, home paths, clock and notification content, window titles, account values, and personal project names;
2. confirm the file is under `docs/images/`, except for the bundled Gold animation under `assets/`;
3. confirm documentation-only images are excluded from the packaged application;
4. record that the image uses synthetic values;
5. remove temporary demo profiles and untracked capture files outside the intended asset path.

Never use the live Hermes database or provider logs to produce a screenshot. Documentation images must not contain credentials, API keys, tokens, cookies, connection strings, or personal machine paths.

## README layout rule

Keep this relationship intact:

- one visual screenshot cell per feature explanation;
- the two Settings screenshots grouped in one visual cell with one detailed explanation beside them;
- the tray image labelled as an illustration;
- the Gold walking asset described as optional;
- all values described as synthetic unless the item is a static bundled asset.
